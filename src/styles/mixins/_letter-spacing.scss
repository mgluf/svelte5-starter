/*
  
  LETTER-SPACING MIXIN  
  
  A mixin for helping prevent alignment issues when applying letter-spacing. 
  When letter-spacing is added, the text is visually shifted to the left. This is
  actually because the final character has the letter-spacing applied to as well
  causing the element to have extra white space on the right side.
  
  It's often not noticable, but is most apparent when text is centered and the 
  letter-spacing is a larger value.

  Use this mixin anytime you want to apply letter-spacing to ensure the text is
  position in it's original, expected placement.

  See #51 for a visual reference.
